## xulBlock Advanced (xBA)

xBA is a fork of [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock) (uBO) for browsers that support [XUL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XUL) add-ons.

I've used it on [Pale Moon](http://www.palemoon.org/), [Basilisk](http://www.basilisk-browser.org/), and [Waterfox](https://www.waterfoxproject.org/). It also should work fine on other browsers with XUL support.

### xBA is only for [Advanced users](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Advanced-user-features)

The main purpose of xBA is to enhance the Advanced user experience, most prominently with changes to the panel and the ability to spoof Referers. These and other changes are covered below.

For uBO users not already on Advanced mode but interested in learning it, xBA is a great way to do so. It's a big learning curve but well worth the effort.

But I must emphasize that it's important to become comfortable with uBO fundamentals before switching to Advanced mode. A more aggresive use of the tool means you will be breaking websites and thus need to learn how to fix things.

## Issues
* If you suspect an xBA bug, check the [Known problems](https://github.com/joey04/xulBlock-Advanced/wiki/Known-problems) wiki page and the issue tracker to see if it's already documented.
* Read [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/joey04/xulBlock-Advanced/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) before filing any issue here.

As an Advanced user, you are expected to figure out all site breakage by yourself; don't ask for help here. If the cause is a 3rd-party filter list problem, contact the list maintainer.

## Why this fork
Several reasons, but let me begin by stating my appreciation for uBO. It's the most impressive browser extension I've ever used, with an unrivaled combination of power and efficiency. Its creator, [gorhill](https://github.com/gorhill), brilliantly designed the core features, and with the help of the community, expanded and refined it into a popular tool. By mid-2017 it reached a very high level of robustness.

Much of the power of uBO stems from being a very hands-on tool in Advanced mode. For me, this has meant lots of time spent with the panel and logger on my primary browser, Pale Moon. This, in turn, revealed a number of ways to improve uBO for it. I ended up making these changes for my own use, as most of my suggestions were either declined or ignored. (I'm not bitter about this; it's how gorhill has managed his busy issue tracker according to [his own priorities](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/2649#issuecomment-304310972).)

I first modified uBO in 2016, but I didn't think to make a publicly-available fork until January 2018. By then, I'd already accumulated a number of changes and Mozilla had recently removed its support of XUL add-ons in Firefox 57. Starting around mid-2017, gorhill's focus shifted to the new WebExt version of uBO for Firefox, which is understandable for a number of reasons, including WebExt having much in common with the Chrome version. As a result, XUL uBO was effectively mothballed, as shown [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Firefox-WebExtensions/1f950bc8d0bfcd55b281549b89e102575924c0ba#future-of-ubolegacy), [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3306), and [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3464).

This is why uBO 1.14.16, released in October 2017, was an easy choice as the fork point for xBA. It's the last version before major refactoring started to land, and I'd already been using my modified version of it for several months without any problems.

## What's different from uBO
There are important changes in xBA, but it must be stated that the _vast majority_ of behavior remains unchanged, especially from the fork point of [uBO 1.14.16](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/releases/tag/1.14.16).

### HTTP Referer spoofing
This is the one feature of uMatrix I wanted that wasn't already in uBO, so I added it. See [its wiki page](https://github.com/joey04/xulBlock-Advanced/wiki/HTTP-Referer-spoofing) for all info.

### The Panel
xBA's Panel has significant changes, all described in [its wiki page](https://github.com/joey04/xulBlock-Advanced/wiki/The-Panel). Be sure to read it before starting out on xBA.

### Hotkeys
* `Alt+P` for the Panel, as described [here](https://github.com/joey04/xulBlock-Advanced/wiki/The-Panel#hotkey-access)
* `Ctrl+Shift+L` to open the Logger for the current tab

There is no option to change these bindings; for that you need a separate hotkey manager extension, e.g. Menu Wizard.

### Blocking popups
By default, xBA uses the uBO behavior for popup blocking rules: a newly opened popup window must have a different URL from its opener before uBO will filter it. I added an [Advanced setting](https://github.com/joey04/xulBlock-Advanced/wiki/Advanced-settings) to allow a second mode of behavior: close the newly opened popup window as soon as possible regardless of its URL. See [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3133) for a discussion of this.

`mustWaitForPopupURLchange` is the setting. It's `true` by default, so set it to `false` to get the new behavior.

**Important note:** Only `*$popup,domain=` rules benefit from the new mode, whereas `no-popups` per-domain rules remain stuck on the default mode. (See [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3164#issuecomment-338967952) for a brief explanation why.) Thus for my own xBA usage, I have a `*$popup,domain=a|b|c` rule for the sites I want to block them without an initial connection to a 3rd-party server.

### Blocking CSP Reports
[CSP Report blocking](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki/Dashboard:-Settings#block-csp-reports) was refactored for uBO 1.14.18. But xBA doesn't need this, as it already can block any CSP Report with either a type `$other` rule or a URL pattern-matching rule.

I block all of them with: `*$other,domain=~behind-the-scene`

I've done this for a long time in Pale Moon without any problems. CSP Reports have been virtually all of the non-bts `$other` traffic I've seen; the few non-CSPs appear to be stray requests worth blocking anyways. However, behind-the-scene (bts) is a completely different story; I don't whitelist it, so I quickly learned I needed the exception to not block essential requests like file downloads.

### Other changes
xBA enforces a strict word-boundary policy for prefix1 rules, as detailed [here](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues/3011).

xBA's SQLite database is located in your profile base directory, not uBO's sub-directory. TheÂ  filename is the same.

## How to Install it
If you have uBO installed, either disable or remove it before installing xBA. Don't run uBO and xBA at the same time because strange things may happen. (Likewise, disable AdBlock Plus or any other blocker extension. Only use one blocker at a time.)

Download the `xulBlock-Advanced.xpi` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/joey04/xulBlock-Advanced/releases). Then drag the xpi file into the browser window. The install dialog should appear. If that's not working, open the `about:addons` page (Tools->Add-ons) then drag it into that window.

I recommend exiting or rebooting the browser after the install. A fresh browser session is the only true guarantee of a clean start.

### Migrating uBO settings
It should be as simple as exporting all of your uBO settings in the Settings tab of the Dashboard then importing this text file into xBA.

If you run into problems, though, a second option is to save your filters and rules as text files in the My filters and My rules Dashboard tabs. Then import those to the same tabs in xBA. You'll have to manually set everything else, but that's not a big deal.
