### First of all:
* Don't ask for help with un-breaking sites. Advanced users figure these things out themselves.
* Contact your list maintainer for any filter problems you encounter. (xBA's list management is the same as uBO's.)
* Don't ask for advice. The [uBO wiki](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/wiki) already has good advice. The [Reddit forum](https://www.reddit.com/r/uBlockOrigin/) may have some too. The most important thing, though, is spending your own time and effort to learn the tool well.
* If you encounter an xBA bug, check the [Known problems](https://github.com/joey04/xulBlock-Advanced/wiki/Known-problems) wiki page and the issue tracker to see if it's already documented.

### Bug Reports
* Must be specific, only addressing a single problem
* Concisely explain the problem
* Must include Steps to Reproduce the problem

Also, if it's a bug already filed on the [uBO issue tracker](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock/issues), it may be closed as a duplicate here.

### Feature Requests
I don't want big changes or feature-creep. xBA is already a great tool with plenty of useful features.

That said, you are welcome to make a specific request. However, if gorhill already rejected this request for uBO, I'll be inclined to do the same here.
